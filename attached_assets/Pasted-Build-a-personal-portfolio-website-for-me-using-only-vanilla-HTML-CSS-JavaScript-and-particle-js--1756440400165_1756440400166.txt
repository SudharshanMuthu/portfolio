Build a personal portfolio website for me using only vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and particle.js (for animated background in the hero section). 
Do not use any frameworks or external CSS libraries. 
The site must include three files: index.html, styles.css, script.js. 
Assets folder should contain profile.jpg (placeholder) and favicon.png (placeholder).

Requirements:
- Modern clean design (2025 trend) with glassmorphism, rounded-xl corners, and soft shadows.
- Responsive: mobile-first, max-width 1200px, flex/grid layouts, sticky header, smooth scroll, scroll-spy for active nav link.
- Automatic dark/light theme using prefers-color-scheme and a JS toggle button (remember user choice in localStorage).
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, alt text, aria-labels, focus styles.
- Performance: no external libraries except particle.js, lazy-load images, inline SVG icons.
- SEO: proper meta tags, Open Graph, favicon, and JSON-LD Person schema.
- Add print.css rules inside <style> in index.html so that clicking “Download Resume (PDF)” uses window.print() and exports a clean one-page resume (hide nav/buttons).
- **Animate on Scroll (AOS effect):** Implement fade-in / slide-up animations for sections and cards using CSS + Intersection Observer (no external libraries).
- Sections order:
  1. Hero (left: circular profile photo with ring, right: Name “SUDHARSHAN M”, Title “Computer Science (AI & ML) Student”, Location: Trichy, India, Quick action buttons: Email Me, Download Resume, LinkedIn, and highlight badges: AI/ML • Full Stack • Cloud).
  2. About (paragraph provided).
  3. Experience (internship timeline cards).
  4. Projects (cards grid with hover effect).
  5. Skills (grouped chips).
  6. Education (timeline).
  7. Certifications (list).
  8. Areas of Interest (chips).
  9. Languages Known.
  10. Contact (only show my details: Trichy | +91 87783 15769 | sudharshan3b@gmail.com, buttons for Email, Call, LinkedIn. NO contact form).
  11. Declaration (auto-fill today’s date via JS, signature styled cursive text).
- Header/Nav: logo with initials “SM”, inline nav on desktop, hamburger on mobile, sticky header, theme toggle button, scroll-spy highlight.
- Floating “Back to Top” button.
- Footer with © year, quick links, and note “Built with HTML/CSS/JS”.
- Particle.js background should run behind the Hero section only.
- Animate on Scroll (AOS): 
  * Sections fade-in and slide-up when scrolled into view. 
  * Project cards should stagger slightly with a small delay.
  * Re-trigger animations only when elements re-enter viewport.
